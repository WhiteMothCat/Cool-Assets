# 🖱 Cursor

Instructions on how to create your own cursor for your computer or how to apply the ones in this folder.

## 🖌 How to create your cursor design 

1. Create your `.png` image
2. Transform the file to `.cur` (recommended webpage: _https://www.vertopal.com/en/convert/png-to-cur_)

For the design of the cursor I propose creating a `.png` image of about 64x64pix, in case you want to use a pixel art style (like the files in this folder). I recommend you move your design to the top left corner of your grid for a better disposition.

## 💾 How to apply your cursor to your computer

### 💻 Windows

2. Go to _themes and related configuration/ mouse cursor/ cursor_
3. Select which cursor and the file you want to change
